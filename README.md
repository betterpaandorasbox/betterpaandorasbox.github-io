# PandorasBox
Pandora'sBox is a mod of Beepbox that adds built-in samples via chip waves. It was made by Blue Cat Productions (although Main figured out how to import samples in the first place).

# Requesting Samples
Request samples on the PandorasBox discord.
Currently, there are three (official) versions that allow you to upload custom samples; The (stable?) beepbox version can be viewed [here](https://pandoras-box.thurm64.repl.co/index.html), while the (stable?) jummbox version can be seen [here](https://pandoras-box.thurm64.repl.co/pandoras-jummbox.html).

The third offical version can be seen [here](insert samplebox link here). It's updated to the latest jummbox version and has several new features, but is really buggy.
